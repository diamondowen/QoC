the key to a bib entry is generated according to the following rules
 1. Four letters plus 2 digits
 2. The 2 digits are for the publication year.
 3. The four letters come from the name(s) of author(s):
    . if there is only one author - the first four letters of last name
        If the last name is less than 4 letters, use first name.
        for example, Gia, John -> GiaJ
    . if there are two authors - two from each author's last name
        example "First Author and Second A. Uthor" ->AuUt
    . if there are three authors - two from the first's last name,
        and one from others' last
    . if there are four authors - one from each's last name
    . if there are more than four authors, use only the first four.
    . if two papers have the same key, please use a, b to distinguish them
Example: "Jack London and John Bull" in 1995 -> LoBu95
